So, a lot of people believe that the war in Afghanistan is the war between Pashtuns. And then Hazaras and other ethnicities are being sacrificed over there just because they are living there.

They don't, they're not violent at all. They respect their women a lot. That's something in their blood. And they're really hardworking because if we see like the history of Hazaras, they are being persecuted by a king in Afghanistan, which killed kind of like 60% of Hazaras in Afghanistan and then enslaved people got their lands and sold their women to India and to Pakistan during his kingdom.
